# KubeApp
This is my university project developed in 2020 for my bachelor degree.
Goal of this project was to learn about Docker containers, Kubernates and distributed deployment.
"KubeApp" is composed by:
- Dummy web application (Tomcat has been used as web server)
- Dummy database (MySQL has been used)

Read my thesis to know what tools have been used and how to deploy the entire system.
